# MachineLearning_Overview
A Lesson in machine learning.

Rock Paper Scissor training data: https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps.zip

Rock Paper Scissor validation set:: https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps-test-set.zip

The training data and validation data should be placed in the tmp directory in the correct directory heigharchical structure in order for the learning programs to find them.

A custom pokemon training and validation data set has been provided for my improvised ai created upon completing the course (machine_learning_14_Build_New_Image_Classifier.py and machine_learning_15_Use_New_Image_Classifier.py).

Tensorflow version: 2.4
Python version: 3.7
